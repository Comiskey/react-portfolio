This drive seeks to increase the number of registered potential donors, which in turn increases the chances of finding a match for cancer patients in need of a bone marrow transplant. I ensure volunteers are able to promote the drive and collect samples from passersby, and that sign-up stations are fully staffed all hours of the event prior to it starting.",

This drive seeks to increase the number of registered potential donors, which in turn increases the chances of finding a match for cancer patients in need of a bone marrow transplant. I train volunteers to effectively promote and effective explain the drive's mission, and collect samples from passersby. Logistically, I ensure that sign-up stations are fully staffed all hours of the event.",
